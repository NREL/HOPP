# Contributing

We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, bug fixes, improvements to the documentation, ideas for enhancements (or the enhancements themselves!).

You can find a [list of current issues](https://github.com/NREL/HOPP/issues) in the project's GitHub repo. Feel free to tackle any existing bugs or enhancement ideas by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/NREL/HOPP/pulls).

## Bug Reports

 * Please include a short (but detailed) Python snippet or explanation for reproducing the problem. Attach or include a link to any input files that will be needed to reproduce the error.
 * Explain the behavior you expected, and how what you got differed.

## Pull Requests

 * Please reference relevant GitHub issues in your commit message using `GH123` or `#123`.
 * Changes should be [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compatible.
 * Keep style fixes to a separate commit to make your pull request more readable.
 * Docstrings are required and should follow the [Google style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html).
 * When you start working on a pull request, start by creating a new branch pointing at the latest commit on [main](https://github.com/NREL/HOPP).
 * The HOPP copyright policy is detailed in the [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/NREL/HOPP/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Documentation

All newly introduced code should be documented in Google format as described in the previous section. To generate the docs:

```
cd docs
make html
```

Then open the docs in your browser:

```
open _build/html/index.html
```

## Tests

The test suite can be run using `pytest tests/hopp`. Individual test files can be run by specifying them:

```
pytest tests/hopp/test_hybrid.py
```

and individual tests can be run within those files

```
pytest tests/hopp/test_hybrid.py::test_hybrid_wind_only
```

When you push to your fork, or open a PR, your tests will be run against the [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://github.com/NREL/HOPP/actions) suite. This will start a build that runs all tests on your branch against multiple Python versions, and will also test documentation builds.

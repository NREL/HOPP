## High-Pressure Reverse Osmosis Desalination Model
"""
Python model of High-Pressure Reverse Osmosis Desalination (HPRO).

Reverse Osmosis (RO) is a membrane separation process. No heating or phase change is necessary.
The majority of energy required is for pressurizing the feed water.

A typical RO system is made up of the following basic components:
Pre-treatment: Removes suspended solids and microorganisms through sterilization, fine filtration and adding chemicals to inhibit precipitation.
High-pressure pump: Supplies the pressure needed to enable the water to pass through the membrane (pressure ranges from 54 to 80 bar for seawater).
Membrane Modules: Membrane assembly consists of a pressure vessel and the membrane. Either sprial wound membranes or hollow fiber membranes are used.
Post-treatment: Consists of sterilization, stabilization, mineral enrichment and pH adjustment of product water.
Energy recovery system: A system where a portion of the pressure energy of the brine is recovered.

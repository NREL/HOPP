# Hybrid Optimization and Performance Platform

![CI Tests](https://github.com/NREL/HOPP/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

As part of NREL's [Hybrid Energy Systems Research](https://www.nrel.gov/wind/hybrid-energy-systems-research.html), this
software assesses optimal designs for the deployment of utility-scale hybrid energy plants, particularly considering wind,
solar and storage.

## Software requirements
- Python version 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 64-bit
- Other versions may still work, but have not been extensively tested at this time

## Installing from Package Repositories
1. HOPP is available as a PyPi package:

    ```
    pip install HOPP
    ```

## Installing from Source
1. Using Git, navigate to a local target directory and clone repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NREL/HOPP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to `HOPP`
    ```
    cd HOPP
    ```

3. Create a new virtual environment and change to it. Using Conda and naming it 'hopp':
    ```
    conda create --name hopp python=3.8 -y
    conda activate hopp
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge coin-or-cbc=2.10.8 -y
    conda install -c conda-forge glpk -y
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    Note if you are on Windows, you will have to manually install Cbc: https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc

    If you also want development dependencies for running tests and building docs:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

5. Install HOPP:
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

6. The functions which download resource data require an NREL API key. Obtain a key from:
    
    [https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/](https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/)
    

7. To set up the `NREL_API_KEY` required for resource downloads, you can create an Environment Variable called 
   `NREL_API_KEY`. Otherwise, you can keep the key in a new file called ".env" in the root directory of this project. 

    Create a file ".env" that contains the single line:
     ```
    NREL_API_KEY=key
    ```

8. Verify setup by running tests:
    ```
    pytest tests/hopp
    ```


2. To set up `NREL_API_KEY` for resource downloads, first refer to section 7 and 8 above. But for the `.env` file method,
   the file should go in the working directory of your Python project, e.g. directory from where you run `python`.

## Getting Started

The [Examples](./examples/) contain Jupyter notebooks and sample YAML files for common usage scenarios in HOPP. These are actively maintained and updated to demonstrate HOPP's capabilities. For full details on simulation options and other features, see the [documentation](https://hopp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

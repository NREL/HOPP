Perform a LCOH analysis for an offshore wind + Hydrogen PEM system

1. Offshore wind site locations and cost details (4 sites, $1300/kw capex + BOS cost which will come from Orbit Runs)~
2. Cost Scaling Based on Year (Have Weiser et. al report with cost scaling for fixed and floating tech, will implement)
3. Cost Scaling Based on Plant Size (Shields et. Al report)
4. Future Model Development Required:
- Floating Electrolyzer Platform (per turbine vs. centralized)

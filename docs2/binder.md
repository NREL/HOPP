# Run Examples on Binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NREL/HOPP/main?labpath=examples)

If you would like to use a separate branch from main, such as develop, simply substitute "main"
in the following link with the name of the branch you are interested in using:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NREL/HOPP/main?labpath=examples.

For instance, the develop branch would use the following link:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NREL/HOPP/develop?labpath=examples

```{note}
When attempting to use Binder for the first time, the build process may take several
minutes. It is best to wait and do not close the browser window until it is finished.
Future launches will be faster as the build environment is saved as a temporary
internet file. 
```
